## Muni Departure Time Uber Code Challenge 
 During this Coding Challenge, I choose to focus upon backend development. 
 I feel like I would be able to show off more of what I can do within a 1 weeks time frame in the backend. Im very new within the industry and had about 1 year of industry backend development, but personally, my experiences were more centered towards backend development to installations. So the reason why I wanted to do backend was to challenge myself to use my knowledge from university and my experience. 

 ## Whats missing and trade-offs 

 One of the main things missing from this app is the use of GPS location. This was due to the fact that I had to spend a couple of days in the begining of the project to understanding the structure of django and learn how to develop in django. In addition to learning how to develop and deploy code through heroku. 

 I also was not able to find the time to do thorough unit testing of the app. I wouldnt know the first step to testing django appliactions, and would have taken me another couple of days to understand the structure and practices used for django testing.  

 I developed the app to be very simple, and tried to make as little call to next_bus as possible. Because of the minimal calls to next_bus, this causes the server to do more parsing of the returning xml. So this becomes a trade-off of speed for webpages since more computations are done in the backend. 

 ## If I had more time. 

 If I had more time for this projec, I would implement GPS location. Grathering data on the location of stops is easy, but grabbing the user's location is something I would need to figure out. Then at that point, its just matter of finding the distance from two points. 

 I would like to also like to make the app look a bit nicer. Spice up the UI a bit. Also modify the index page so that the sorting is done with letter first before the numbers.
